# Launch Files

**With launch files, we can run multiple related nodes simultaneously.**

Notice in section 2.4, we have to start up three terminals:
1. One to run `roscore`
2. One to run `rosrun pub_sub publisher.py`
3. One to run `rosrun pub_sub subscriber.py`

This will keep increasing with the number of nodes. With launch files, we can simplify this process.

## Example of creating a launch file

In this section, we create a launch file that launches the two nodes we created in section **2.4. ROS program in Python** simultaneously.

Let's create a launch file within the `pub_sub` package. Change your directory to `pub_sub`:

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/pub_sub
```

Create a `launch` directory to store all your launch files
```bash
mkdir launch
cd launch
```

Create a `start_nodes.launch` file (or any other names), then add the following text:
```xml
<launch>
    <!-- Run the publisher node -->
    <node pkg="pub_sub" type="publisher.py" name="publisher_node" output="screen"/>
    <!-- Run the subscriber node -->
    <node pkg="pub_sub" type="subscriber.py" name="subscriber_node" output="screen"/>

</launch>
```
Notice that we had to specify:

* The name of the package, in this case `pub_sub`
* The type of file to run, in this case `publisher.py` and `subscriber.py`
* The name of the node created within this file.

As always, before running the edited package, we rebuild the workspace with
```bash
catkin build
```

Now, to achieve the same results as previously, we only need two terminals.
1. One to run `roscore`
2. Second to run `roslaunch pub_sub start_nodes.launch`
