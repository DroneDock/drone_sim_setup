# Enabling WSL
This file outlines the step required to setup WSL for Windows. Skip this if you are already using a Linux System.

## 1. Enabling Virtualization for Windows
Launching WSL require virtualization technology since WSL acts akin to a virtual machine. The three steps required to enable virtualization is outlined in [this page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1), but just to reiterate:

### a. Enable Virtual Machine Platform and WSL
* Select **Start**, enter **Windows Features**, and select **Turn Windows features on or off** from the list of results.
* In the **Windows Features** window that just opened, enable **Virtual Machine Platform** and **Windows Subsystem for Linux**
* Restart your computer now as prompted.

### b. Enable Virtualization through UEFI/BIOS
Although virtualization for Windows is enabled, we must enable the same feature for the CPU to utilize WSL. This may be enabled already, but let's check.

* Select **Start**  > **Settings** > **System**  > **Recovery** > **Advanced startup**, then select **Restart now**.
* Once your PC restarts, you'll see a screen that displays *Choose an option*. Select **Troubleshoot** > **Advanced options** > **UEFI Settings** > **Restart**.
* After the restart, you will enter the UEFI/BIOS, where the advanced configurations for the computer can be seen. The layout for the UEFI depends on your computer, but in general you need to go to **Advanced Settings** or **CPU Settings**, then enable **Virtualization Technology**.
* Choose the **Save and Restart** option.

After the restart, Windows should be able to use WSL, but some work still needs ot be done.

## 2. Installing WSL
Now we need to install a Linux distribution - there are innumerable types of Linux to choose from. This repository will introduce you to Ubuntu (A Debian-based Linux Distribution).

### a. Install Linux
Go to **Microsoft Store** and download a Linux distribution, for example **Ubuntu-22.04 LTS**.

### b. Setting up Linux
* Use the Windows search bar and search for the downloaded linux. This will launch a new terminal.

* You will be prompted to setup a Unix username and password. **Make sure to remember this!**

You are now ready to use the Linux via its terminal.

### 3. (Not Required) Installing WSL on non-C Drive
By default, installing WSL via the steps above will install WSL in the C Drive, which is where your Operating System (OS) resides. Space is valuable within the C Drive, so you can optionally install it in other disks.

The steps required to do this is outlined [here](https://dev.to/mefaba/installing-wsl-on-another-drive-in-windows-5c4a), but just to reiterate:

### a. Check WSL installations that are already installed.
You can see the list of Linux distributions installed in your computer via the command:
```
wsl --list -v
```

![](../docs/WSL%20list.png)

Make sure the Linux distribution is terminated. If not, simply run the below command. Replace "Ubuntu-22.04" with your appropriate Linux distro.
```
wsl -t Ubuntu-22.04
```

### b. Export Ubuntu to a folder
We can export the current Ubuntu in the C Drive into the D drive as a *.tar* file with this command:
```
wsl --export Ubuntu-22.04 "D:\ubuntu-ex.tar"
```

### c. Unregister previous WSL
Before registering the new Ubuntu in the D Drive, let's remove the installed Ubuntu in the C Drive. Simply run:
```
wsl --unregister Ubuntu-22.04
```


### d. Import WSL to D Drive
Officially import WSL installation to a folder. This step also registers Ubuntu. This command may vary depending on the location where you want Linux to be installed and the location of the *.tar* previously exported. This corresponds to the first and second arguments respectively. For example, the below command saves Ubuntu into the folder "D:\wsl\ubuntu-22.04".
```
wsl --import "D:\wsl\ubuntu-22.04" "D:\ubuntu-ex.tar"
```

### e. (Possible Errror) Configuring user
Open your Linux terminal, now on the D drive. It is possible that you start within the "/root" directory instead of "/home/usr". You should start at the "~" symbol, as shown below. If this is not the case, proceed with below, which reiterates this [solved issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4276).

![Alt text](<../docs/WSL Correct Home Directory.png>)

* Open Linux terminal and run `id -u <yourUserName>`. This will display your Unix ID.
* Search for **Registry Editor** in Windows and navigate to ```HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss\{MY-UUID}```. Replace the `DefaultUid` value with the Unix ID shown previously. **Make sure the units are in decimal, not hexadecimal**.

Opening another Linux terminal should now return you to the correct directory.
