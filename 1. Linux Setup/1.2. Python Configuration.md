# Configuring Python Environment
This file outlines the steps to configure your python version in your Linux or
WSL environment.

Older Linux versions ship with older python versions.

## Installing new python version

First, update the list of repositories to let the operating system know where
it can download the newer versions of python. This is found in the "deadsnakes"
repository. Do this by:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes:ppa
sudo apt update
```

Now you can just install the new python versions using `apt`. For example, to
install python 10, do:
```bash
sudo apt install python 3.10
```

## Configuring python versions

There is normally multiple python versions in a system. For example, Ubuntu
18.04 ships with `python2` and `python3`. See the default python version by:
```bash
python --version
```
For Ubuntu 18.04, this will return `python2`, since this is the default option.
Essentially, the word `python` is just a symbolic link - and it currently points
towards `python2`.

Let's say we want the `python` keyword to point to `python3`. To do this, we
do:
```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 2
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python2 1
```
What we have done in the code above is we allow the `python` command to point
towards both `python3` and `python2`, but we allow `python3` to take a priority
of 2 and `python2` to take a priority of 1. Naturally, the one with a higher
priority will be the default. Hence when you run `python --version`, you will
see `python3`.
