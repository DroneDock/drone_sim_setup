# Connecting to SITL

The simulated vehicle can be connected to via IP addresses. It is imperative to let MAVProxy forward the connections to the correct IP address so that foreign programmes can connect to the simulated vehicle.

## Finding your IP address

Programs such as **Mission Planner**, **MAVROS** and/or **dronekit** connect to
SITL via IP addresses. We need to know this IP address to ensure other programs
can reach the simulated SITL drone. 

Do this in Linux using the command:

```bash
ifconfig
```

Or in Windows:
```bash
ipconfig
```

This will return something like:
```bash
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.29.4.129  netmask 255.255.240.0  broadcast 172.29.15.255
        inet6 fe80::215:5dff:fe8d:e31c  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 00:15:5d:8d:e3:1c  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)

        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 477620  bytes 38413347 (38.4 MB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

lo: flags=73<UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING>  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10<host>
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 4621952  bytes 1848486785 (1.8 GB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 4621952  bytes 1848486785 (1.8 GB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

We look for the IP address in the `eth0` category. In this case it is in the second line - `172.29.4.129`. This is the IP address that we need to specify as an output when running SITL (i.e., `--out 172.29.4.129:14451`) to allow the system of IP address `172.29.4.129` to connect to the vehicle.

<summary> <b> Additional Information for my curiosity </b> </summary>
With the information of the IP address (172.29.4.129) and the network mask (255.255.24.0), we can know two things:

- Network address - This part of the IP address identifies which network/subnetwork the system operates in. Devices within the same network share the same network address.
- Host address - This part of the IP address identifies a specific device within the network.
