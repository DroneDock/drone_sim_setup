# Building ArduPilot for SITL (Optional)

The software behind a drone is essentially an autopilot executable (.exe) file 
that is uploaded to a flight controller. We may need this executable from one of 
two reasons:  
* To simulate a drone, we need to run the autopilot executable in our computer
* To upload the autopilot executable to a flight controller

## Building the ArduPilot/ArduCopter executable

The steps to do this are outlined [here](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-linux.html)
by the official ArduPilot site.

1. Clone the ardupilot repo.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git
    ```
2. Install required packages, then log-in and log-out to make changes permanent.

    ```bash
    cd ardupilot
    Tools/environment_install/install-prereqs-ubuntu.sh -y
    . ~/.profile
    ```

3. Build the binary using the `waf` command. You can change the board and vehicle depending on your usage.
    ```bash
    ./waf configure --board sitl
    ./waf copter
    ```

    To build the ArduCopter binary, a compatible C++ compiler is needed, which is
    a `g++` compiler of version 9+. if this is not available in your Ubuntu version, see **1.1. C Compiler Configuration**  to see
    how to download this.
