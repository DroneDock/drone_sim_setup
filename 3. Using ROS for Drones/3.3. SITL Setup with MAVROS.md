# SITL Setup with MAVROS

This page follows the steps outlined [here](https://masoudir.github.io/mavros_tutorial/).

## 1. Setting up SITL
Initialize a SITL drone so that our ROS program can connect to it.

For the case of Ardupilot SITL, you need compiler version `g++-10` to build
the autopilot executable, otherwise it will return an error. You can download
the new compiler version following **1.1. Compiler Configuration.md**.

After building the compiler, you can run the vehicle by running the command
below, replacing the IP address with the IP address of your computer (in the
case of WSL, the IP of your WSL terminal). In a Linux environment, check your
IP using the `ifconfig` command.

**You might need to switch to `python3` to run this command**. See **1.2. Python
configuration.md** for information on how to do this. But remember to switch
back - ROS melodic runs on python2 at its core.
```bash
sim_vehicle.py --out "172.23.176.1:14451"
```
* `sim_vehicle.py` is the script responsible for launching the vehicle. It also
launches MAVProxy during initialization.
* `--out "172.23.176.1:14451"` creates an additional output for other pieces of
software to connect to. By default, the vehicle can only be connected to via
`14450`. By creating another output, we can allow two software to connect to it,
such as **MissionPlanner** and our ROS node.

## 2. Using MAVROS to connect to SITL

### Launch ROS
Now that a (simulated) drone is running, we want to setup ROS. In another
terminal, launch ROS with this command.
```
$ roscore
```

### Launch MAVROS
In another terminal, we run the following command to tell MAVROS where to find
the vehicle and connect to it. As always, make sure the IP address is changed
for your computer.
```
roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=udp://172.23.176.1:14450@
```

### Check connection status
If running the command above did not result in an error, it is likely that
the connection is successful. You can check in another terminal by running
```bash
rostopic echo /mavros/state/connected
```
