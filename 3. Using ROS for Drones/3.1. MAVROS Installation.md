# MAVROS Installation

### What is MAVROS?
MAVROS is just like any ROS package. It is a ROS package that translates
ROS commands/topics to MAVLink messages for drone communication, and vice versa.

First, we install **MAVROS** itself. Here, we install for ROS Melodic. Change
this in accordance to your ROS version.
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-mavros ros-melodic-mavros-extras
```

You also need to install **GeographicLib**, which allows conversion of geodetic
and geocentric coordinates, which may be required for MAVROS to work.
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mavlink/mavros/master/mavros/scripts/install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
chmod a+x install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
sudo ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh
```

* `wget` installs the specified file from the web into the current directory
* After installation, we do not have the permission to run the file. We give it
permission with te `chmod a+x` command which stands for change mode. `a` means
all user, `+x` makes it executable. Therefore, running this command makes the
file executable for all users
* `sudo ./install_geographiclib_datasets.sh` Use admin permission to run the 
shell script, which will download the file
