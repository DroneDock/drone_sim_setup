# Gazebo for ROS

There is a ROS plugin for Gazebo which takes data from Gazebo and publishes it
on ROS topics. 

## Short Introduction on Gazebo


### Common Files
There are two types of file you might encounter when working with Gazebo:

* `.world` contains the physics of the world simulated by Gazebo. For example,
you can specify the physics engine.
    * Differential equations that describe how states in the world changes with 
    time, including the solver, iterations, precision etc.
    * Ambient scenery of the world.
    * Presence of shadow.
* `.sdf` files are models that can be inputted into gazebo. The information
within these files include:
    * Mass of the files
    * Moments of Inertia
    * Mesh Size

You can launch worlds using `.launch` files. Within them you can specify
parameters such as "show simulation time", "debug mode". Of course, this can
also be used to launch nodes, such as a node that spawns the model of the robot
into the simulation environment.
