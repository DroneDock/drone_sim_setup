# Building ArduPilot for SITL (Optional)

The software behind a drone is essentially an autopilot executable (.exe) file 
that is uploaded to a flight controller. We may need this executable from one of 
two reasons:  
* To simulate a drone, we need to run the autopilot executable in our computer
* To upload the autopilot executable to a flight controller

## Building the ArduPilot/ArduCopter executable

The steps to do this are outlined [here](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/building-setup-linux.html)
by the official ArduPilot site.

To build the executable file, we first need a compatible C++ compiler, which is
a `g++` compiler of version 10+. See **1.1. C Compiler Configuration**  to see
how to download this.
