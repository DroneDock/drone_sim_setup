# Controlling the drone with `dronekit`

`dronekit` provides a simple python API to control the drone.

To control the vehicle, you must first connect to it. This is done via a connection string. Read [2.3. Connecting to SITL](../2.%20SITL%20Setup/2.3.%20Connecting%20to%20SITL.md) to understand how to specify the connection string.
