# Controlling the drone with MAVROS

https://masoudir.github.io/mavros_tutorial/

## Create MAVROS Package
Let's create a package called `drone_control`.

```bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
catkin_create_pkg drone_control rospy 
```

## Launch the Simulation
### Launch ROS
Now that a (simulated) drone is running, we want to setup ROS. In another
terminal, launch ROS with this command.
```bash
roscore
```

### Launch MAVROS
In another terminal, we run the following command to tell MAVROS where to find
the vehicle and connect to it. As always, make sure the IP address is changed
to whatever `--out` outputs of SITL.
```bash
roslaunch mavros apm.launch fcu_url:=udp://172.29.4.129:14451@
```

### Check connection status
If running the command above did not result in an error, it is likely that
the connection is successful. You can check in another terminal by running
```bash
rostopic echo /mavros/state/connected
```
